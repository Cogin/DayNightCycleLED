# DayNightCycleLED

A python script for WS2811 LEDs to simulate a day-night cycle in the comfort of your own room.

## Requirements
I am running this off of a Raspberry Pi 4 but a similar board should work just fine with some tweaking. \
WS2811 LEDs [(amazon link)](https://www.amazon.com/ALITOVE-LED-Individually-Addressable-Waterproof/dp/B01AG923GI) \
5V3A AC/DC power adapter [(another amazon link)](https://www.amazon.com/ALITOVE-100V-240V-Converter-5-5x2-1mm-Security/dp/B078RXZM4C) \
Jumper wires (not required but recommended) [(a third amazon link, wow)](https://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-EL-CP-004-Multicolored-Breadboard-arduino/dp/B01EV70C78)
